6.Select a threshold and channel on which to apply the VSC on Image threshold range is good between 40-80.<br/>
7.Now you can use the "visual decryption" button to check for watermark.<br/>
<br/>

-left and right arrows adjust the key on image.<br/>
<br/>
high threshold will reduce image quality.<br/>
