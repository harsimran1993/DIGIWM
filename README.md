5.apply visual-encryption on watermark(monochrome watermark) using "encrypt & VSC" button.
6.Select a threshold and channel on which to apply the VSC on Image threshold range is good between 40-80.
7.Now you can use the "visual decryption" button to check for watermark.

high threshold will reduce image quality.
